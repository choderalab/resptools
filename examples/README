# Example use of batch RESP code

# First, make sure that the ../python directory and the OEChem toolkits are in Python path.
# For John's Mac OS X:
setenv PYTHONPATH ../python:${HOME}/local/src/openeye/wrappers/python:${HOME}/local/src/openeye/wrappers/libs
setenv DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH ${HOME}/local/src/openeye/wrappers/libs

# Set up files/directories for batch processing by GAMESS.
mkdir molecules
python2.3 ../python/setupBatchResp.py --input guthrie.mol2 --outdir molecules/

# Now submit the jobs to the batch queue.  A convenience script is provided to submit these jobs as sets of SGE array jobs for each molecule.
cd molecules
sh submit_all.sh

# Wait patiently...

# Analyze the results for each molecule separately to produce a mol2 file.
# The mol2 file with RESP charges will end up in the same dir as the GAMESS calculation was run.
python2.3 ../python/analyzeBatchResp.py --dir molecules/ch3oph
